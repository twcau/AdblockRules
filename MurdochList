# Michael H's custom blocking list
# Murdoch publications
# 
# Version 0.1.02a
# Last updated 16.02.2021 1320hrs AWST
#
#
# Purpose:
# This blocklist blocks all content from Murdoch owned or affiliated websites, that can be used in any web browser, plugin, or ad blocking app
# that supports the use of AdBlock-based rules.
#
#
# How to use?
# Add the web address of this list as a subscription within your AdBlock client, and *shazam* - your internet experience will be Murdochless.
# 
#
# Never used AdBlock rules before?
# Explaination of AdBlock rules:
# https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000066909-introduction-to-filter-lists
#
# Clients and applications that support AdBlock rules: 
# Plugins are available for use with most modern web browsers, on both desktop and mobile devices.
# - For desktops and laptops, I personally recommend and trust AdBlock Plus: https://adblockplus.org/
# - For mobile devices (iOS, Android), AdGuard is my go-to: https://adguard.com/en/products.html
# - For home networks: Pi-Hole (https://pi-hole.net/), or AdGuard Home (https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) to cover all devices
#   on your home internet connection.
#
#
# Want to add something to the list?
# If you know how to use Github, go forth and commit. 
# And if you don't - send me a tweet: https://twitter.com/twcau
