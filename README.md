# AdblockRules
This is where you'll find the AdBlock rules I use, and some of the rulesets I've created to deal with things other lists don't focus on.

# My lists

- MurdochList (blocks all websites affiliated with the Murdoch empire): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twcau/AdblockRules/master/MurdochList ([AdBlock Plus Subscription Link](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ftwcau%2FAdblockRules%2Fmaster%2FMurdochList&amp;title=MurdochList))
- CustomSonyTVList (stops unnecessary traffic from Smart TV's dead in their tracks): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twcau/AdblockRules/master/CustomSonyTVList ([AdBlock Plus Subscription Link](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ftwcau%2FAdblockRules%2Fmaster%2FCustomSonyTVList&amp;title=CustomSonyTVList))


# Other useful lists

# How to use?

Add the web address of one or more lists as a subscription within your AdBlock client, and *shazam* - your internet experience will be that little more free of those things which abuse your privacy and suck up your data like greasy hors d'oeuvres.

# Clients and applications that support AdBlock rules: 
Plugins are available for use with most modern web browsers, on both desktop and mobile devices:

- For desktops and laptops, I personally recommend and trust AdBlock Plus: https://adblockplus.org/
- For mobile devices (iOS, Android), AdGuard is my go-to: https://adguard.com/en/products.html
- For home networks: Pi-Hole (https://pi-hole.net/), or AdGuard Home (https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) to cover all devices on your home internet connection.
