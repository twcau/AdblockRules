# AdblockRules
My adblock rules for use in Adguard and other platforms

* [List sources](https://github.com/twcau/AdblockRules/blob/master/ListSources.MD): Summary of the lists I use for Adblocking, inc. my own custom lists.

# Purpose:

These blocklists assist with capturing some of the other nasties and annoyances which other block lists don't really focus on.

# How to use?

Add the web address of this list as a subscription within your AdBlock client, and *shazam* - your internet experience will be Murdochless.

# Never used AdBlock rules before?

# Clients and applications that support AdBlock rules: 
Plugins are available for use with most modern web browsers, on both desktop and mobile devices:

- For desktops and laptops, I personally recommend and trust AdBlock Plus: https://adblockplus.org/
- For mobile devices (iOS, Android), AdGuard is my go-to: https://adguard.com/en/products.html
- For home networks: Pi-Hole (https://pi-hole.net/), or AdGuard Home (https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) to cover all devices on your home internet connection.
