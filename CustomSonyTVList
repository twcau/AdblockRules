# Explaination of AdBlock rules:
# https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000066909-introduction-to-filter-lists
#
#
# Clients and applications that support AdBlock rules: 
# Plugins are available for use with most modern web browsers, on both desktop and mobile devices.
# - For desktops and laptops, I personally recommend and trust AdBlock Plus: https://adblockplus.org/
# - For mobile devices (iOS, Android), AdGuard is my go-to: https://adguard.com/en/products.html
# - For home networks: Pi-Hole (https://pi-hole.net/), or AdGuard Home (https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) 
#   to cover all devices on your home internet connection.
